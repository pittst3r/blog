  <h1>Humanist Software Design</h1>
  <p>2025-06-04 Robert Pitts</p>

  <hr />

  <p>Humanist software design means designing software that communicates a mental model from its author to its readers and users&mdash;from human to human. Controlling machines is secondary. It’s about expressing behavior in a way that’s understandable and intuitive to another person.</p>

  <p>This principle applies at every level, from graphical interfaces to low level tools. In all cases, we reduce cognitive load by organizing complexity; expressing cogent, focused ideas on a need-to-know basis. We do this by layering and structuring interfaces so that only what's relevant is exposed at the right time, supporting clear and unburdened thought.</p>

  <p>Let's make software with a thoughtful, human-centered approach to conveying intent. Correctness, velocity, teamwork, trust... The rest will all fall into place.</p>
